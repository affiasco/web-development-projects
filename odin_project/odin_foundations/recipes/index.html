          Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or
          ground chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and
          seasoned with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil.
          It's a classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants
          and as a popular street food

          Oyakodon is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of
          chicken saut√©ed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished
          with egg and served over rice. It's really easy, filling, and
          delicious.

          Bulgogi, or Korean barbecued beef, is made with marinated sliced beef.
          Most recipes call for crushed pear to tenderize the meat. My
          boyfriend's Korean mother says Coca-Cola can also be used for the same
          purpose. This recipe uses very thinly-sliced sirloin steak, so
          tenderization isn't necessary. It's delicious served with rice,
          lettuce leaves, and chile paste or kimchi.
