      <h2 class="stbc-header-shadow">Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>For the Dish</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced shallots</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="stbc-header-shadow">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="ol-item">
          Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar,
          and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
        </li>
        <li class="ol-item">
          Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and
          stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in
          shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat
          until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan,
          about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture
          to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about
          1 minute.
        </li>
        <li class="ol-item">
          Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed
          the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the
          meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li class="ol-item">
          Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds.
          Serve with rice.
        </li>
      </ol>
