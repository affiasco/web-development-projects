Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors Project JavaScript Project

Odin's Rock Paper Scissors Project \
Create a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer \
This is a JavaScript project from the Odin Project and can be found on the [Odin Project's Website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) \
The first iteration of this was to purely exist in the console

This work showcases my ability to:

- Write basic JavaScript Functions
- Utilize standard array and string methods in JavaScript
- Iteract with users on the webpage to get a response and use that response within a function
- Further fluency with command line
