Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors Project JavaScript Project

Odin's Rock Paper Scissors Project \
Create a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer \
This is a JavaScript project from the Odin Project and can be found on the Odin Project's Website ([Part One](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), [Part Two](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors)) \
The first iteration of this was to purely exist in the console
The second iteration adds an interactive website with styling

This work showcases my ability to:

- Write basic JavaScript Functions
- Utilize standard array and string methods in JavaScript
- Iteract with users on the webpage to get a response and use that response within a function
- Select, create, and manipulate items within a DOM
- Utilize event listeners and call corresponding page function
- Practice CSS Flexbox and HTML page structure
- Further fluency with command line
