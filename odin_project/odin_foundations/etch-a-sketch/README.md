Odin Project's Etch a Sketch Project JavaScript Project

Odin's Etch a Sketch Project \
Create an 'Etch a Sketch' board using JavaScript that will allow a hover over a grid to color individual divs. For bonus added a slider to change the grid size and a 'Randomize it' button to change the colors \
This is a JavaScript project from the Odin Project and can be found on the [Odin Project's Website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) \

This work showcases my ability to:

- Write more complex JavaScript Functions
- Strong emphasis on doing more complex actions with eventlisteners and callback functions
- Select, create, and manipulate items within a DOM
- Utilize loops for inserting items into a DOM
- Also includes extra js file to create grid utilizing Canvas instead of creating divs
- Practice CSS Flexbox and HTML page structure
- Further fluency with command line
